# How to run
1. Clone the project.
2. Install `CPython 3.10`, `redis` and `postgresql(Recommended)`.
3. Install pipenv using `pip install pipenv`.
4. Change directory to `./src` folder and run `pipenv install --dev` for development and `pipenv install` for production.
5. Move `.env.example` to `.env` by `mv .env.example .env` and configure as you wish!
6. Now you can run it by `python manage.py runserver` for development, or use gunicorn(or any other WSGI HTTP server) for production.
